# Abstract

This is a bookmark manager for recording web content and websites that I wrote as my final project for CS50/2020. It supports creating, editing and deleting of bookmarks, as well a search facility for quickly finding related content around search terms.  Each user must be registered and authenticated through a username and a password. Internally, this information is organized in several tables of a relational database implemented with
Sqlite. Each bookmark is comprised of a category, a url, a title and a optional description. The application'sfrontend is implemented with _HTML_, _CSS_, _Bootstrap_, _Javascript_, _jQuery_, while the
backend is programmed with _Python_, _Flask_ and the _Sqlite_ database.
