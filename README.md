# Abstract

This is a bookmark manager for recording web content and websites that I wrote as my final project for Harvards's CS50/2020. It supports creating, editing and deleting of bookmarks, as well a search facility for quickly finding related content around search terms.  Each user must be registered and authenticated through a username and a password.  The bookmarks can be displayed either in __list__ or __grid__ mode. The second mode is comprised of link preview images obtained with the free API provided by [linkpreview.net](https://www.linkpreview.net/). Each bookmark is comprised of a category, a url, a title and a optional description. There is also support for importing bookmarks from _Google Chrome_ and _Microsoft Edge_.  The application is implemented with _HTML_, _CSS_, _Bootstrap_, _JavaScript_, _jQuery_, _Python_, _Flask_ and the _SQlite_ database.  You can see it live [here](https://bkmark-mg.herokuapp.com/).
