This is a bookmark manager for recording web content and websites that 
I wrote as my final project for CS50/2020. It supports creating, 
editing and deleting of bookmarks, as well a search facility for quickly 
finding related content around search terms.  Each user must be registered and 
authenticated through a username and a password. Internally, this information is 
organized in several tables of a relational database implemented with
Sqlite. Each bookmark is comprised of a category, a url, a title and a 
optional description. The application is implemented with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
Javascript, jQuery, Sqlite and Python Flask.
